Int_How generally bright you are. As a rule, this is more than sheer intelligence, but also includes cleverness, awareness, perception, and ability to learn.
Ref_Your response time and coordination, as used in aiming, throwing, juggling. A stage magician, for example, would have a high Reflex Statistic. Most importantly, this is the Statistic that affects your ability to hit things.
Tech_Your ability to manipulate tools or instruments. This is not the same as reflexes, inasmuch as this covers the knack of using tools. One character might have a high Technique, but might not be able to fence or juggle. On the other hand, another might have high Reflexes, but only a fair level of Technique.
